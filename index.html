                Welcome to my website! This is the first website I made in
                my AP Computer Science class. I have made many other websites prior
                to this one. This website is built with a pixelated theme. I chose
                this theme because I love pixel art. My goal is to make this website
                as pretty looking and professional as possible. I hope you enjoy 
                looking at my website as much as I did creating it.
