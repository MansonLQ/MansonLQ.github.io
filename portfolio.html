                            This is my very first Scratch Game that I made as a project! The scoring system that I used is 
                            based on a damage indicator. The first person  wins. I added an element of random 
                            number generators via the crate that respawns randomly throughout the game. As the game is played,
                            the players recieve more access to the crate and thus it becomes increasingly harder to avoid
                            being hit from fast bullets.

                            I created this type of game using inspiration from an Ipad game I used to play.
                            I decided to make my own version of the game with new improvements according to my likings.
                            I encountered many successes during the making of my game. Two included the code for moving
                            the sprites and the discovery of how to use the random blocks. Along with success, there came
                            a few obstacles. Obstacles I faced while programming the game were trouble with bullet cloning
                            and sprite interactions. To overcome these obstacles, I conducted reseach and recieved knowledge
                            on how to use the cloning and broadcast blocks. I am quite glad with the result of my game, but if
                            I had more time to work I would have added more powerups.

                             Above is my move algorithm that is crucial for controlling the movement of the tanks. This is an 
                             algorithm because it is constantly performing loops that checks if the control keys are pressed.
                             If one of the control keys are pressed, then it will turn or move 3 steps depending on the key. If the
                             sprite runs into a wall, then it will be set back 3 steps. At the end of the algorithm is a custom block that
                             checks if the player has ammo. If the player has ammo, power will be set to 1 and the player's next shot 
                             will be a fast rocket.
